This code contains tools from Percy Liang's Unsupervised NLP Modeling Toolkit (v1.0)
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pliang/software/unsupervised-modeling-1.0.zip

The Hypergraph code has been modified to perform computations in log-space. 
The code now works with unsupervised and supervised models with probability
and weight parameters. Generic dynamic programming using hypergraphs is included.
